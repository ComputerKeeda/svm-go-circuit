# svm-go-zk circuit

A Go library for generating zero-knowledge proofs of Solana transactions. This implementation focuses on privacy and scalability for Solana-based applications.

## Features

- zk-circuit implementation for proving Solana transaction validity
- Go-based for easy integration into Solana development environments
- Supports privacy-preserving transaction verification

> Note : verifier is not present in this implementation. It will be added in future.
